# Sortable Ads Wordpress Plugin

A WordPress plugin for putting up Sortable ad tags on your site without breaking a sweat.

## Installation

Copy folder `sortable-ads` to the WordPress plugin folder, e.g. `wp-content/plugins`.

## Features

For now this only works for adding hardcoded ad tags.

## License

Sortable wants to keep it proprietary because this plugin is not intended to let everyone be able to install it via the
public channel.

## Developer Notes

The entry file is `sortable-ads/sortable-ads.php`.

Edit `sortable-ads/includes/SortableAds.php` if you want to edit the pre-defined ad tag list.

Help page content is in `sortable-ads/admin/views/help-page.php`.
